# Learning Management App

The Learning Management App is a android application designed to facilitate course management with a focus on ease of use and efficient data management. It provides functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting courses across two main categories: frontend and backend. The app is built on the MVVM architecture pattern, leveraging data binding for seamless UI updates and Room Database for persistent storage.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, separating concerns and providing a clear structure for scalability and maintainability.

- **Data Binding**: Utilizes Android's Data Binding library to bind UI components directly to data sources in the ViewModel, reducing boilerplate code and improving code readability.
